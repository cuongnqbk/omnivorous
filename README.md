# Ominvorous
## A recipe manager/lifestyle/cooking utility app built with NodeJS and Mongo

### Features 

Omnivorous aspires to (someday) be a social cooking utility that 
* collects, stores, and organizes your recipes. 
* helps you plan and build your weekly shopping list. 
* lets you share what you are cooking and see what your friends are cooking.
* helps you organize gourmet groups, potluck dinners, and cocktail clubs by (eventually) facilitating scheduling, budgeting, recipe distribution, ingredient shopping, and the like.

Other, long-term feature ambitions include:
* Automated recipe import from anywhere on the web
* Obscure Ingredient Finder: see where (and when) other users have found hard-to-find ingredients in your area (or online)
* Farmer's Market / CSA / Sustainable Agriculture connector: find and keep tabs on local produce

### Project Status

In the interest of full transparency, this is a pet project pursued wholly for autodidactical reasons.
